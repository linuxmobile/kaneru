Tips / Installation / **Archlinux**

## ISOS

🔅 First download the official ISO from [Here](https://archlinux.org/download)

🔅 Write the ISO to a USB:

```bash
# If we're using another Linux distro we can do the following
fdisk -l # to find the USB partition
dd if=$HOME/Downloads/archlinux-version-xxx.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M # bs=1M is optional
```

If we're using **Windows** we can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie)

## Boot from USB and install the BASE

🔅 Next, we need to restart from the USB. Normally with `F2` or
`Del` we should be able to enter the BIOS and select the USB.

🔅 Boot Archlinux and continue

🔅 Configure the keyboard layout with `loadkeys us` **If you don't use a US keyboard
you can check which layout to use with: `ls -R /usr/share/kbd/keymaps`**

🔅 Enable parallel downloads.

```bash
nano /etc/pacman.conf

# Uncomment the "ParallelDownloads" option and specify the number we want. In my case five seems perfect.
ParallelDownloads = 5
```

🔅 Save with:

`Ctrl` + `o` & `Ctrl` + `x`

🔅 Update the repositories

```bash
pacman -Syy
```

🔅 Partitions:

    **NOTE**: In my case, I keep the disk without dual boot, I only have one operating system which is
    Archlinux/Artix. But I'll show the method I use if I need to keep Windows (for some reason!)

```bash
# with fdisk I check the partition names
fdisk -l

# Create the /boot folder and delete the previous boot from the distro I normally have

mkdir -p /mnt/boot/
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/
```

_I do this step to avoid having to create another EFI partition, I use the
same one as Windows, and I don't format this partition_

```bash
# delete the archlinux boot entries

rm {*.img}
rm vmlinuz-linux
rm -rf grub/
rm -rf EFI/arch/
```

_Leaving the EFI/Microsoft folder untouched_

🔅 Then format the partition where the root will go `mkfs.btrfs -F /dev/nvme0n1p5/`
and continue with the installation.

🔅 Partition the disk:

👉 **Note:** **In my case my disk is NVME, so replace NVME with sda, sdb
or whatever you have.**

```bash
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

```
      Start                  Size
/dev/nvme0n1p1               512M         # 512M / 1GB recommended

/dev/nvme0n1p2               60G          # 40/60GB

/dev/nvme0n1p3              405.3G        # The rest of the space
```

👉 **Note:** <i>This installation is exclusively for UEFI, and
also consider that I'm not using dual boot. Just arch/artix.</i>

🔅 Format the partitions:

```bash
# In this case I use xfs for my home and root partition. You can choose btrfs or ext4...
mkfs.xfs -L ROOT /dev/nvme0n1p2        # Root partition
mkfs.xfs -L HOME /dev/nvme0n1p3        # Home partition (optional)
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1          # EFI/boot partition
fatlabel /dev/nvme0n1p1 EFI
```

🔅 Mount the partitions:

```bash
mount /dev/disk/by-label/ROOT /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mount /dev/disk/by-lable/HOME /mnt/home
mount /dev/disk/by-label/EFI /mnt/boot
```

### Install the base:

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware nano dhcpcd
```

🔅 Generate the fstab file

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### Configuring our system

🔅 Change to root in our system

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

🔅 Configure the clock

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime  # Here we need to put the region/city.
```

👉 **Note:** **With hwclock we generate /etc/adjtime**

```bash
hwclock --systohc
```

🔅 Generate the locales

```bash
# Uncomment whichever you prefer. I prefer the system in English
nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen

# Here we can edit the file and select our favorite
nano /etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF=8 # in my case, I prefer en_US

nano /etc/vconsole.conf
KEYMAP=us
```

🔅 Install the bootloader:

```bash
pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```

👉 **Note 3:** **My configuration is designed for UEFI systems. Pay attention...**

🔅 Install grub:

```bash
# If you're using MBR and not UEFI:
# grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --recheck

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

🔅 Set the ROOT password:

```bash
passwd # when you hit enter, type the password.

useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash yourusername # Obviously, type your username here!

passwd yourusername
```

🔅 Add WHEEL to sudoers file:

```bash
EDITOR=nano visudo
# uncomment: (removing the #)
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

🔅 Configure the hostname:

```bash
nano /etc/hostname
# hostname is giving a name to the host:
# I like "aesthetic" So it can be like your nickname.
```

🔅 Add it to hosts:

::: code-output-flex

```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```

```bash
127.0.0.1               localhost
::1                     localhost
127.0.1.1               yourhostname.localdomain yourhostname

# replace "yourhostname" with the hostname you chose.
```

:::

🔅 Install DHCPCD (internet client):

```bash
pacman -S dhcpcd dhcpcd-dinit
```

🔅 Unmount and reboot:

```bash
exit                    # To exit su
exit                    # To exit chroot
umount -R /mnt          # To unmount
reboot                  # To reboot
```

At this point after rebooting and not getting any errors or
issues, it means you have finished installing the base Archlinux system.

I'd like to leave you with some additional steps (tips) that helped me when
I didn't understand anything.

🔅 Enable DHCPCD to have internet:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd
```

🔅 Install paru: **If we don't have git, we need to install it
`sudo pacman -S git wget`.**

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
```

🔅 Finally, some packages that will be useful:

```bash
# Handle zip, rar files.
sudo pacman -S zip unzip unrar

# Alsa and pipewire for audio
sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse alsa-utils

# To be able to view external disks
sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g dosfstools exfat-utils

# Intel / AMD drivers
paru -S xf86-video-amdgpu vulkan-radeon mesa-libgl mesa-vdpau libvdpau-va-gl libva-mesa-driver #AMD
paru -S xf86-video-intel mesa-libgl libvdpau-va-gl #Intel
```

    Well, that's all. I hope it helped you. If you made it this far, please check out my
