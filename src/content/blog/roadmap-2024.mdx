# 2024 Professional Development Roadmap

## Introduction

After two years of coding experience, I still wrestle with **Impostor Syndrome** - that persistent voice suggesting _"you're not good enough"_ or _"you don't know enough"_.

For 2024, I've decided to focus on personal growth and building professional confidence. Here's my **Technical Development Roadmap** for becoming a **Frontend Expert**.

## Frontend Development Focus

### JavaScript Mastery

My foundation in **JavaScript** is solid, reinforced by my participation in the 2023 [AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/) coding challenges, which sharpened my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

However, I'm committed to mastering these advanced concepts:

- [Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays)
- [Equality Comparison Algorithms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)
- [Event Loop Architecture](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#what-is-the-event-loop)
- [Iterators & Generators](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/advanced-js/iteration-iterators)
- [Garbage Collection Mechanisms](https://javascript.info/garbage-collection)
- [Memory Management Lifecycle](https://medium.com/swlh/the-lifecycle-of-memory-in-javascript-5b5bffc5ff4cf)
- [Memory Leak Detection and Resolution](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/debugging-javascript-memory-leaks)
- **Performance Optimization Techniques**

My Q1-Q2 goal is to thoroughly understand these advanced JavaScript concepts, elevating my expertise beyond basic proficiency.

### React Enhancement

While I'm proficient with **React**, I aim to transition from documentation-dependent development to comprehensive understanding. Key focus areas include:

- Advanced Hook Implementation:
  - [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
  - [useMemo](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usememo-hook/)
- Routing Systems (React Router & Reach Router)
- GraphQL Integration:
  - Apollo Client Implementation
- Testing Frameworks:
  - Jest
  - Vitest
  - PlayWright
- Data Fetching:
  - Axios
  - SWR
- **React Native Development**

### Vue.js Adoption

To diversify my framework expertise beyond Next.js, I'm committed to learning **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

### Architecture & Design

- Design Patterns and Systems
- Atomic Design Methodology
- CSS Architecture:
  - BEM Methodology
  - SUIT Convention
- Quik Framework

## Backend Technologies

### Rust Development

By mid-2024, I plan to begin learning **Rust**. Having migrated my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/linuxmobile/kaku) tools to Rust-based alternatives for their superior performance and memory efficiency, I aim to contribute to the **Free Software** ecosystem by developing Linux tools.

### TypeScript Advancement

While familiar with **TypeScript** basics, I aspire to achieve advanced proficiency in type systems and TypeScript-specific patterns.
