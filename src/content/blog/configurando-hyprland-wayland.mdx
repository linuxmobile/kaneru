If you've come this far it's because you must have heard about **Hyprland** or
**Wayland**. In this _tutorial-like guide_ I'm going to teach you how to configure
both to look like this:

## Installing Packages and Dependencies

_Obviously, we'll start by installing the necessary packages and some
dependencies that we'll need_

ðŸ”… Paru as **AUR Helper**

_I use [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) because it's written in
**Rust**, it's fast and very functional._

```shell
echo "### Installing paru as AUR Helper"
mkdir $HOME/Downloads/_cloned-repos
cd $HOME/Downloads/_cloned-repos
git clone --depth 1 https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
```

ðŸ”… Hyprland + Waybar + Wayland

_It's enough to install hyprland for the wayland packages to be installed, since
they are listed as its dependencies._

```shell
paru -S hyprland-git waybar-hyprland-git
```
